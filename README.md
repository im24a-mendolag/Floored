## Survival

Survival is a roguelike run mode layered on top of the same 18 games. Each run consists of 10 floors; every floor has a bankroll quota you must reach within a 5-minute timer or the run ends.

**Difficulties**

| Difficulty | Quota multiplier | Shop price multiplier |
|---|---|---|
| Normal | ×1.0 | ×1.0 |
| Hard | ×1.5 | ×1.5 |
| Nightmare | ×2.5 | ×2.0 |

**Floor quotas (Normal)**

| Floor | Target bankroll |
|---|---|
| 1 | $2,000 |
| 5 | ~$60,000 |
| 10 | $1,000,000 |

Quota scales exponentially: `$2,000 × 500^((floor−1)/9)`.

**Sparks**

Sparks are the meta-currency earned by completing floors and missions. Spend them in the between-floor shop.

**Shop**

The shop appears between floors. It offers:
- **Run upgrades** — passive boosts that apply for the rest of the run (e.g. payout multipliers)
- **Game perks** — game-specific upgrades with tiered levels (e.g. Card Counter for Blackjack, Early Cashout for Crash)
- **Consumables** — one-time-use items (e.g. extra lobby reroll tickets)
- Shop inventory can be rerolled for an escalating sparks cost

**Missions**

Each floor has 3 randomly assigned missions (e.g. "win 3 rounds in a row", "hit a ×5 multiplier", "play Crash once"). Completing missions awards bonus sparks.

**Run end**

A run ends when your bankroll hits $0 before the quota, time runs out, or you clear all 10 floors. A run summary is shown at the end.
